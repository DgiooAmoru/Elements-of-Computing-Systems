# Elements-of-Computing-Systems
Learning Path in Programming and Computer Systems
This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning about programming and computer systems. The primary source of my learning is the book "The Elements of Computing Systems - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. The secondary source is the book "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" by Charles Petzold.

The purpose of this repository is to save the changes and advancements I make in my learning journey. I will be documenting my progress, keeping track of my notes, and uploading any relevant code and projects that I complete as part of this learning journey.

This repository serves as a personal portfolio of my growth in the field of computer systems and programming, and I hope that others who are also interested in this area can learn from my journey or even join me on it.

I am excited to delve into the world of computer systems and programming and see where this journey takes me. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how computers work at a fundamental level and to be able to apply this knowledge to real-world projects and problems.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope that you will find the contents here to be informative and helpful.
